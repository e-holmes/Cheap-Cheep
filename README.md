The concept behind this Application is that allows users to create personal shopping lists of many different kinds of items. Originally the App will find the lowest price on these items across a variety of websites and direct the user to the best deal on each item on their list.
As the process of building App we experienced some obstacles so, users can search for item with specific website that is 
1. **Walmart**
2. **Craigslist**
 
 This app allows user to create accout. User can able to login with validate username and password. Once login, App allows user to create list, search for the item with mentioned website.  save item to the list,  delete item from list and view item on list.
